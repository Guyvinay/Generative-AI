# 1. **Tuple Unpacking**: Create a list of tuples, each containing a name and an age. Then, use tuple unpacking to iterate through the list and print each name and age.


    # - *Output*: "John is 25 years old. Jane is 30 years old."

input= [("John", 25), ("Jane", 30)]

print(f"{input[0][0]} is {input[0][1]}. {input[1][0]} is {input[1][1]}")
